6/15 NJH
- Fixed a bug that caused the ItemEditorComponent to fail to reload the form when clicking on the header's "New Item" button while editing an existing item.
- Same fix as above for the StoryEditorComponent.


6/14 NJH
- Finalized new direct download for in-memory-data.service.ts file. The "Make Data Service File" fetches the formatted and up-to-date file from the new ServerFileService then is replaced by a Download button which initiates the file download. In order to work around Angular's security scrubbing, the download URI is sanitized manually by a separate Angular Component.
- Removed the now obsolete ServerFileDumpComponent.



6/12 NJH
- Testing in-memory downloads by replacing the ServerDumpComponent with a ServerFileService which serves up a URI encoded string. Security issues are still a problem.



6/8 NJH
- Built multiple tagging interface for items.
- Built multiple image representation and interface for items.
- Added item insertion/deletion to stories.



6/6 NJH
- Standardized styling and templating updates from 6/5 across all components.
- When adding images to items, put the image in the src/graphics/ directory then use only the filename for the item. The app will automatically look in the graphics directory.



6/5 NJH
- Renamed "/collection" route to "/home"
- On the home page, the item and story lists are now linked to button selectors at the top of the page.
- Redesigned List and Detail layouts for Items and Stories.
- Added delete feature to Details. Watch out! There is no "are you sure?" or Undo feature at present.



5/31 11:40pm - NJH
- Added the "Make Server File" link which dumps the text of a valid mock server class file to the screen, containing all of the user's current items and stories.
- In order to save the changes, copy and paste the contents of this file into storybarrow/src/app/in-memory-data.service.ts completely. (Use Ctrl+A on Win or Cmd+A on OSX to select the contents of the page before copying.)
- Find an appropriately labeled backup copy of in-memory-data.service.ts in the /src/app directory.
